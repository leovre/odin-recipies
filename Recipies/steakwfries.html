    <h1>The Great Steak (with Fries)</h1>
    <img src="../images/steak.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Beautiful steak cooked medium with the extra flavors of Fries</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (2 pound) butcher's steak (hanger steak)</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon clarified butter</li>
        <li>2/3 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove all silver skin and extra fat from the steak. <br>
            Carefully cut out the connective tissue that connects the 2 halves of the steak, separating the whole into 2 long pieces.<br> 
            Cut lobe of meat from one half (it's a piece that is slightly separated from the larger half).<br>
             Then cut each of the 2 larger halves into 2 steaks each. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Heat skillet over high heat. Add clarified butter when pan is hot, then place the steaks in the pan. Reduce heat to medium. <br>
            Cook until browned on all sides, firm, and reddish-pink on the inside. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center <br>
            should read 125 degrees F (52 degrees C), a total of about 12 minutes. (This cut of meat has a sort of triangular shape, so about 4 minutes per side.)<br>
             Transfer to a warm plate and tent with foil to let steaks rest and allow temperature to rise to 130 degrees F.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Pour stock into skillet set over medium heat. Stir with a wooden spoon scraping up the browned bits from the bottom.<br>
             When brownings dissolve and liquid begins to reduce after 2 or 3 minutes, reduce heat to low. Add accumulated juices <br>
             from the meat, balsamic vinegar, and butter chunks. Cook and stir until butter melts. <br>
            If liquid has reduced too much, add a splash of broth. Taste to check if sauce needs a bit of salt.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            To serve, slice steaks and spoon pan sauce over them.
        </li>
    </ol>
