    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup of salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground white pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>10 pounds baby back pork ribs</li>
        <li>1 cup apple juice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup barbeque sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir salt, white sugar, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, black pepper, white pepper,<br> 
            onion powder, garlic powder, chili powder, paprika, and cumin together in a small bowl to make the dry rub. <br>
            Rub the spice mixture into the baby back ribs on all sides. Wrap the ribs well with plastic wrap, <br>
            and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes prior to cooking.
         </li>
         <br>
         <li>
            Unwrap baby back ribs and place onto the wire racks of <br>
            the smoker in a single layer.
         </li>
         <br>
         <li>
            Place the racks into a smoker, fill the smoker pan with apple, grape, pear, or cherry chips, <br>
             and bring the smoker to 270 degrees F (130 degrees C). Smoke for 1 hour.
         </li>
         <br>
         <li>
            Stir together the apple juice, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and the barbeque sauce.<br>
             Brush the ribs with the sauce every 30 to 45 minutes after the first hour.<br>
             Cook the ribs in the smoker until the meat is no longer pink and begins to "shrink" back from the bones, 3 to 4 hours.<br>
            Brush the sauce onto the ribs one last time 30 minutes before the ribs are ready to be taken out of the smoker.<br>
         </li>
         <br>
         <li>
            Once the ribs are done, wrap them tightly with aluminum foil, and allow to rest 10 to 15 minutes. <br>
            This will allow the juices to reabsorb into the meat and make the ribs moist.
         </li>
    </ol>
